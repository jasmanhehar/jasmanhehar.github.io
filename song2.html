	    Yeah they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'<br>
They wishin' on me, yuh<br>
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me<br>
<em>Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me</em><br>
Don’t pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me<br>
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me<br>
I don’t wanna die for them to miss me<br>
Yes I see the things that they wishin' on me<br>
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me<br>
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me<br>
<strong>God's plan, God's plan</strong><br>
</P1>
<P1>
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh<br>
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ay, don't<br>
I finessed down Weston Road, ay, 'nessed<br>
<em>Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait</em><br>
I go hard on Southside G, yuh, Way<br>
I make sure that north-side eat<br>
And still<br>
</P1>
<P2>
Bad things<br>
It's a lot of bad things<br>
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'<br>
They wishin' on me<br>
Bad things<br>
It's a lot of bad things<br>
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'<br>
They wishin' on me<br>
Yuh, ay, ay<br>
She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"<br>
<strong>I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry</strong><br>
</P2>
<P2>
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me<br>
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party<br>
And you know me<br>
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog<br>
<strong>Without 40, Oli', there'd would be no me</strong><br>
Imagine if I never met the broskies<br>
God's plan, God's plan<br>
I can't do this on my own, ay, no, ay<br>
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close<br>
I've been me since Scarlett Road, ay, road, ay<br>
Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait<br>
I go hard on Southside G, ay, Way<br>
I make sure that north-side eat, yuh<br>
And still<br>
</P2>
<P1>
Bad things<br>
<em>It's a lot of bad things<br>
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'<br>
They wishin' on me</em><br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Bad things<br>
It's a lot of bad things<br>
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'<br>
They wishin' on me<br>
Yeah<br>
